## Background

This application's goal is mainly to learn a few different technologies (Postgres, Angular, etc.) before starting work in Summer 2026. The idea of innovating on book tracking apps comes largely from a dissatisfaction with using GoodReads. I usually having no issues working with Letterboxd, which accomplishes the same goal but for a different medium of content. So I want to bring some UI elements from Letterboxd to this application in an inspired and innovative way.
